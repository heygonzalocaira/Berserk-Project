# Berserk Game Project

Currently, we see every time that games appear for all platforms, the root of that, most of the games that appear as innovators and are losing the classic games. Therefore, the game Berserk proposes to revive a classic game, in this case, the game Super Smash Bros is taken as a reference (Super Smash Bros., known in Japan as Nintendo All Star!).
